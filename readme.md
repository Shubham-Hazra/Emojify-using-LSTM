## Emojify using LSTM
This project is to use pre trained GloVe embeddings to analyize the sentiment of a sentence and predict an appropriate emoji for that sentence. First a simple logistic regression model is tried and then a more sophisticated model is made using LSTMs. The model is built using Keras API.\
